	 * 3. There are 2 files A and B with elements of type string. It is desired to obtain a list of
strings in which the elements of A and B appear, two by two, so that the first 2 elements
of A are selected, then the first 2 of B, and so on (if at the end of any of the files there is
only 1 element left, only 1 is selected instead of 2). Note that:
• once the end of a file is reached, all the elements of the other file that are still
pending must then be included in the resulting list.
• complete dumping of input files into intermediate structures (such as lists, sets
or arrays) is not allowed, i.e. you must make use of iterators directly on the files.
The only such structure allowed to be created is the one used to build the
resulting list.
